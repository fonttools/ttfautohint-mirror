 * occurred.  *num_glyphs* holds the total number of glyphs in the font
 * (this value can't be larger than 65535).

/*
 * Callback: `TA_Info_Func`
 * ------------------------
 *
 * A callback function to access or modify strings in the `name` table; it
 * is called in a loop that iterates over all `name` table entries.  If
 * defined, [`TA_Info_Post_Func`](#callback-ta_info_post_func) gets executed
 * after this loop so that the collected data can be written back to the
 * `name` table.
 *
 * *platform_id*, *encoding_id*, *language_id*, and *name_id* are the
 * identifiers of a `name` table entry pointed to by *str* with a length
 * pointed to by *str_len* (in bytes; the string has no trailing NULL byte).
 * Please refer to the [OpenType specification of the `name` table] for a

/*

 *
 * A callback function, giving the application the possibility to access or

 * table entries.
 *
 * It is expected that `TA_Info_Func` stores pointers to the `name` table

/*
 * Function: `TTF_autohint`
 * ------------------------
 *
 * Read a TrueType font, remove existing bytecode (in the SFNT tables
 * `prep`, `fpgm`, `cvt `, and `glyf`), and write a new TrueType font with
 * new bytecode based on the autohinting of the FreeType library, optionally
 * using a reference font to derive blue zones.
 *
 * It expects a format string *options* and a variable number of arguments,
 * depending on the fields in *options*.  The fields are comma separated;
 * whitespace within the format string is not significant, a trailing comma
 * is ignored.  Fields are parsed from left to right; if a field occurs
 * multiple times, the last field's argument wins.  The same is true for
 * fields that are mutually exclusive.  Depending on the field, zero or one
 * argument is expected.
 *
 * Note that fields marked as 'not implemented yet' are subject to change.
 *
 *
 * ### Memory Management
 *
 * The next two fields are necessary on some platforms if ttfautohint is
 * compiled as a shared library, and the application uses a different
 * runtime library.  This can happen, for example, on the MS Windows
 * platform if your program is written in Python and communicates via [the
 * 'ctypes' interface](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) with
 * the ttfautohint DLL.
 *
 * `alloc-func`
 * :   A pointer of type [`TA_Alloc_Func`](#function-pointer-ta_alloc_func)
 *     specifying a memory allocation function.  It gets used to allocate
 *     the buffer given by the `out-buffer` field and the data exposed by
 *     the [`TA_Info_Func`](#callback-ta_info_func) callback.  If not set or
 *     set to NULL, or if `out-buffer` is not set or set to NULL,
 *     standard\ C's `malloc` function is used.
 *
 * `free-func`
 * :   A pointer of type [`TA_Free_Func`](#function-pointer-ta_free_func)
 *     specifying a memory deallocation function.  It gets called to free
 *     the data exposed by the [`TA_Info_Func`](#callback-ta_info_func)
 *     callback after it has been used.  If not set or set to NULL, or if
 *     `out_buffer` is not set or set to NULL, standard\ C's `free` function
 *     is used.
 *
 *
 * ### I/O
 *
 * `in-file`
 * :   A pointer of type `FILE*` to the data stream of the input font,
 *     opened for binary reading.  Mutually exclusive with `in-buffer`.
 *
 * `in-buffer`
 * :   A pointer of type `const char*` to a buffer that contains the input
 *     font.  Needs `in-buffer-len`.  Mutually exclusive with `in-file`.
 *
 * `in-buffer-len`
 * :   A value of type `size_t`, giving the length of the input buffer.
 *     Needs `in-buffer`.
 *
 * `out-file`
 * :   A pointer of type `FILE*` to the data stream of the output font,
 *     opened for binary writing.  Mutually exclusive with `out-buffer`.
 *
 * `out-buffer`
 * :   A pointer of type `char**` to a buffer that contains the output
 *     font.  Needs `out-buffer-len`.  Mutually exclusive with `out-file`.
 *     The application should deallocate the memory with the function given
 *     by `free-func`.
 *
 * `out-buffer-len`
 * :   A pointer of type `size_t*` to a value giving the length of the
 *     output buffer.  Needs `out-buffer`.
 *
 * `control-file`
 * :   A pointer of type `FILE*` to the data stream of control instructions.
 *     Mutually exclusive with `control-buffer`.
 *
 *     See '[Control Instructions](#control-instructions)' for the syntax
 *     used in such a file or buffer.
 *
 * `control-buffer`
 * :   A pointer of type `const char*` to a buffer that contains control
 *     instructions.  Needs `control-buffer-len`.  Mutually exclusive with
 *     `control-file`.
 *
 * `control-buffer-len`
 * :   A value of type `size_t`, giving the length of the control
 *     instructions buffer.  Needs `control-buffer`.
 *
 * `reference-file`
 * :   A pointer of type `FILE*` to the data stream of the reference font,
 *     opened for binary reading.  Mutually exclusive with
 *     `reference-buffer`.
 *
 * `reference-buffer`
 * :   A pointer of type `const char*` to a buffer that contains the
 *     reference font.  Needs `reference-buffer-len`.  Mutually exclusive
 *     with `reference-file`.
 *
 * `reference-buffer-len`
 * :   A value of type `size_t`, giving the length of the reference buffer.
 *     Needs `reference-buffer`.
 *
 * `reference-index`
 * :   The face index to be used in the reference font.  The default value
 *     is\ 0.
 *
 * `reference-name`
 * :   A string that specifies the name of the reference font.  It is only
 *     used to emit a sensible value for the `TTFA` table if `TTFA-info` is
 *     set.
 *
 *
 * ### Messages and Callbacks
 *
 * `progress-callback`
 * :   A pointer of type [`TA_Progress_Func`](#callback-ta_progress_func),
 *     specifying a callback function for progress reports.  This function
 *     gets called after a single glyph has been processed.  If this field
 *     is not set or set to NULL, no progress callback function is used.
 *
 * `progress-callback-data`
 * :   A pointer of type `void*` to user data that is passed to the
 *     progress callback function.
 *
 * `error-string`
 * :   A pointer of type `unsigned char**` to a string (in UTF-8 encoding)
 *     that verbally describes the error code.  You must not change the
 *     returned value.
 *
 * `error-callback`
 * :   A pointer of type [`TA_Error_Func`](#callback-ta_error_func),
 *     specifying a callback function for error messages.  This function
 *     gets called right before `TTF_autohint` exits.  If this field is not
 *     set or set to NULL, no error callback function is used.
 *
 *     Use it as a more sophisticated alternative to `error-string`.
 *
 * `error-callback-data`
 * :   A point of type `void*` to user data that is passed to the error
 *     callback function.
 *
 * `info-callback`
 * :   A pointer of type [`TA_Info_Func`](#callback-ta_info_func),
 *     specifying a callback function for manipulating the `name` table.
 *     This function gets called for each `name` table entry.  If not set or
 *     set to NULL, `TA_Info_Func` is not called.
 *
 * `info-post-callback`
 * :   A pointer of type [`TA_Info_Post_Func`](#callback-ta_info_post_func),
 *     specifying a callback function for manipulating the `name` table.  It
 *     is called after the function specified with `info-callback` has
 *     iterated over all `name` table entries.  If not set or set to NULL,
 *     `TA_Info_Post_Func` is not called.
 *
 * `info-callback-data`
 * :   A pointer of type `void*` to user data that is passed to the info
 *     callback functions.
 *
 * `debug`
 * :   If this integer is set to\ 1, lots of debugging information is print
 *     to stderr.  The default value is\ 0.
 *
 *
 * ### General Hinting Options
 *
 * `hinting-range-min`
 * :   An integer (which must be larger than or equal to\ 2) giving the
 *     lowest PPEM value used for autohinting.  If this field is not set, it
 *     defaults to
 *     [`TA_HINTING_RANGE_MIN`](#preprocessor-macros-typedefs-and-enums).
 *
 * `hinting-range-max`
 * :   An integer (which must be larger than or equal to the value of
 *     `hinting-range-min`) giving the highest PPEM value used for
 *     autohinting.  If this field is not set, it defaults to
 *     [`TA_HINTING_RANGE_MAX`](#preprocessor-macros-typedefs-and-enums).
 *
 * `hinting-limit`
 * :   An integer (which must be larger than or equal to the value of
 *     `hinting-range-max`) that gives the largest PPEM value at which
 *     hinting is applied.  For larger values, hinting is switched off.  If
 *     this field is not set, it defaults to
 *     [`TA_HINTING_LIMIT`](#preprocessor-macros-typedefs-and-enums).  If it
 *     is set to\ 0, no hinting limit is added to the bytecode.
 *
 * `hint-composites`
 * :   If this integer is set to\ 1, composite glyphs get separate hints.
 *     This implies adding a special glyph to the font called
 *     ['.ttfautohint'](#the-.ttfautohint-glyph).  Setting it to\ 0 (which
 *     is the default), the hints of the composite glyphs' components are
 *     used.  Adding hints for composite glyphs increases the size of the
 *     resulting bytecode a lot, but it might deliver better hinting
 *     results.  However, this depends on the processed font and must be
 *     checked by inspection.
 *
 * `adjust-subglyphs`
 * :   An integer (1\ for 'on' and 0\ for 'off', which is the default) to
 *     specify whether native TrueType hinting of the *input font* shall be
 *     applied to all glyphs before passing them to the (internal)
 *     autohinter.  The used resolution is the em-size in font units; for
 *     most fonts this is 2048ppem.  Use this only if the old hints move or
 *     scale subglyphs independently of the output resolution, for example
 *     some exotic CJK fonts.
 *
 *     `pre-hinting` is a deprecated alias name for this option.
 *
 *
 * ### Hinting Algorithms
 *
 * ttfautohint provides three different algorithms for computing
 * horizontal stem widths and the positioning of blue zones.
 *
 * * `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_NATURAL`: No adjustments to stem
 *   widths, discrete blue zone positioning.  This is what FreeType uses for
 *   its 'light' (auto-)hinting mode.
 *
 * * `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_QUANTIZED`: Both stem widths and blue zone
 *   positions are slightly quantized to take discrete values.  For
 *   example, stem values 50, 51, 72, 76, and 100 would become 50, 74, and
 *   100 (or something similar).
 *
 * * `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_STRONG`: If active, stem widths and blue zones are
 *   snapped and positioned to integer pixel values as much as possible.
 *
 * These values are arguments to ttfautohint's three different hinting mode
 * options.
 *
 * `gray-stem-width-mode`
 * :   Specify the stem width algorithm for grayscale rendering.  Possible
 *     integer values are `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_NATURAL`,
 *     `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_QUANTIZED` (the default), and
 *     `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_STRONG`, as discussed above.
 *
 * `gdi-cleartype-stem-width-mode`
 * :   Specify the stem width algorithm for GDI ClearType rendering, this
 *     is, the rasterizer version (as returned by the GETINFO bytecode
 *     instruction) is in the range 36\ <= version <\ 38 and ClearType is
 *     enabled.  Possible integer values are `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_NATURAL`,
 *     `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_QUANTIZED`, and `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_STRONG` (the
 *     default), as discussed above.
 *
 * `dw-cleartype-stem-width-mode`
 * :   Specify the stem width algorithm for DW ClearType rendering, this is,
 *     the rasterizer version (as returned by the GETINFO bytecode
 *     instruction) is >=\ 38, ClearType is enabled, and subpixel
 *     positioning is enabled also.  Possible integer values are
 *     `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_NATURAL`, `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_QUANTIZED` (the
 *     default), and `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_STRONG`, as discussed above.
 *
 * `increase-x-height`
 * :   An integer.  For PPEM values in the range 6\ <= PPEM
 *     <= `increase-x-height`, round up the font's x\ height much more often
 *     than normally (to use the terminology of TrueType's 'Super Round'
 *     bytecode instruction, the threshold gets increased from 5/8px to
 *     13/16px).  If it is set to\ 0, this feature is switched off.  If this
 *     field is not set, it defaults to
 *     [`TA_INCREASE_X_HEIGHT`](#preprocessor-macros-typedefs-and-enums).
 *     Use this flag to improve the legibility of small font sizes if
 *     necessary.
 *
 * `x-height-snapping-exceptions`
 * :   A pointer of type `const char*` to a null-terminated string that
 *     gives a list of comma separated PPEM values or value ranges at which
 *     no x\ height snapping shall be applied.  A value range has the form
 *     *value*~1~`-`*value*~2~, meaning *value*~1~ <= PPEM <= *value*~2~.
 *     *value*~1~ or *value*~2~ (or both) can be missing; a missing value is
 *     replaced by the beginning or end of the whole interval of valid PPEM
 *     values, respectively.  Whitespace is not significant; superfluous
 *     commas are ignored, and ranges must be specified in increasing order.
 *     For example, the string `"3, 5-7, 9-"` means the values 3, 5, 6, 7,
 *     9, 10, 11, 12, etc.  Consequently, if the supplied argument is `"-"`,
 *     no x\ height snapping takes place at all.  The default is the empty
 *     string (`""`), meaning no snapping exceptions.
 *
 * `windows-compatibility`
 * :   If this integer is set to\ 1, two artificial blue zones are used,
 *     positioned at the `usWinAscent` and `usWinDescent` values (from the
 *     font's `OS/2` table).  The idea is to help ttfautohint so that the
 *     hinted glyphs stay within this horizontal stripe since Windows clips
 *     everything falling outside.  The default is\ 0.
 *
 * `gray-strong-stem-width`
 * :   Deprecated.  The argument values 0 and 1 of this field correspond to
 *     the argument values `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_QUANTIZED` and
 *     `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_STRONG` of the field 'gray-stem-width-mode',
 *     respectively.
 *
 * `gdi-cleartype-strong-stem-width`
 * :   Deprecated.  The argument values 0 and 1 of this field correspond to
 *     the argument values `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_QUANTIZED` and
 *     `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_STRONG` of the field
 *     'gdi-cleartype-stem-width-mode', respectively.
 *
 * `dw-cleartype-strong-stem-width`
 * :   Deprecated.  The argument values 0 and 1 of this field correspond to
 *     the argument values `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_QUANTIZED` and
 *     `TA_STEM_WIDTH_MODE_STRONG` of the field
 *     'dw-cleartype-stem-width-mode', respectively.
 *
 *
 * ### Scripts
 *
 * `default-script`
 * :   A string consisting of four lowercase characters that specifies the
 *     default script for OpenType features.  After applying all features
 *     that are handled specially, use this value for the remaining
 *     features.  The default value is `"latn"`; if set to `"none"`, no
 *     script is used.  Valid values can be found in the header file
 *     `ttfautohint-scripts.h`.
 *
 * `fallback-script`
 * :   A string consisting of four lowercase characters, specifying the
 *     default script for glyphs that can't be mapped to a script
 *     automatically.  By default, such glyphs are hinted; if option
 *     `fallback-scaling` is set, they are scaled only instead.  Valid
 *     values can be found in the header file `ttfautohint-scripts.h`.
 *
 *     Default value is `"none"`, which means hinting without using a
 *     script's blue zones if `fallback-scaling` isn't set.  If
 *     `fallback_scaling` is set, value `"none"` implies no hinting for
 *     unmapped glyphs.
 *
 * `fallback-scaling`
 * :   Set this integer to\ 1 if glyphs handled by the fallback script
 *     should be scaled only with the fallback script's scaling value,
 *     instead of being hinted with the fallback script's hinting
 *     parameters.
 *
 * `symbol`
 * :   Set this integer to\ 1 if you want to process a font that ttfautohint
 *     would refuse otherwise because it can't find a single standard
 *     character for any of the supported scripts.  ttfautohint then uses a
 *     default (hinting) value for the standard stem width instead of
 *     deriving it from a script's set of standard characters (for the latin
 *     script, one of them is character 'o').  The default value of this
 *     option is\ 0.
 *
 * `fallback-stem-width`
 * :   Set the horizontal stem width (hinting) value for all scripts that
 *     lack proper standard characters.  The value is given in font units
 *     and must be a positive integer.  If not set, or the value is zero,
 *     ttfautohint uses a hard-coded default (50\ units at 2048 units per
 *     EM, and linearly scaled for other UPEM values, for example 24\ units
 *     at 1000 UPEM).
 *
 *     For symbol fonts (i.e., option `symbol` is given),
 *     `fallback-stem-width` has an effect only if `fallback-script` is set
 *     also.
 *
 *
 * ### Miscellaneous
 *
 * `ignore-restrictions`
 * :   If the font has set bit\ 1 in the 'fsType' field of the `OS/2` table,
 *     the ttfautohint library refuses to process the font since a
 *     permission to do that is required from the font's legal owner.  In
 *     case you have such a permission you might set the integer argument to
 *     value\ 1 to make ttfautohint handle the font.  The default value
 *     is\ 0.
 *
 * `TTFA-info`
 * :   If set to\ 1, ttfautohint creates an SFNT table called `TTFA` and
 *     fills it with information on the parameters used while calling
 *     `TTF_autohint`.  The format of the output data resembles the
 *     information at the very beginning of the dump emitted by option
 *     `debug`.  The default value is\ 0.
 *
 *     Main use of this option is for font editing purposes.  For example,
 *     after a font editor has added some glyphs, a front-end to
 *     `TTF_autohint` can parse `TTFA` and feed the parameters into another
 *     call of `TTF_autohint`.  The new glyphs are then hinted while hints
 *     of the old glyphs stay unchanged.
 *
 *     If this option is not set, and the font to be processed contains a
 *     `TTFA` table, it gets removed.
 *
 *     Note that such a `TTFA` table gets ignored by all font rendering
 *     engines.  In TrueType Collections, the `TTFA` table is added to the
 *     first subfont.
 *
 * `dehint`
 * :   If set to\ 1, remove all hints from the font.  All other hinting
 *     options are ignored.
 *
 * `epoch`
 * :   An integer of type `unsigned long long`, defined as the number of
 *     seconds (excluding leap seconds) since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC.  If
 *     set, or if the value is not equal to `ULLONG_MAX`, this epoch gets
 *     used instead of the current date and time for the 'modification time'
 *     field in the TTF header.  Use this to get [reproducible
 *     builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/).
 *
 *
 * ### Remarks
 *
 *   * Obviously, it is necessary to have an input and an output data
 *     stream.  All other options are optional.
 *
 *   * `hinting-range-min` and `hinting-range-max` specify the range for
 *     which the autohinter generates optimized hinting code.  If a PPEM
 *     value is smaller than the value of `hinting-range-min`, hinting still
 *     takes place but the configuration created for `hinting-range-min` is
 *     used.  The analogous action is taken for `hinting-range-max`, only
 *     limited by the value given with `hinting-limit`.  The font's `gasp`
 *     table is set up to always use grayscale rendering with grid-fitting
 *     for standard hinting, and symmetric grid-fitting and symmetric
 *     smoothing for horizontal subpixel hinting (ClearType).
 *
 *   * ttfautohint can process its own output a second time only if option
 *     `hint-composites` is not set (or if the font doesn't contain
 *     composite glyphs at all).  This limitation might change in the
 *     future.
